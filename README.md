# newftldat
super crummy unpacker and repacker of ftl.dat for FTL v1.6.1 in python (3.5+) but it works and I'm super happy

place extractor.py in the same folder as ftl.dat and run it to extract the files into a directory currently hardcoded to "extractions1"

place builder.py in the same directory with the audio, img, data, fonts dirs and the exe_icon.png file and run it to repack the files into a ftl.dat (which gets placed in the current directory)
